# Theory

- **Motor Issues:** Drone motors can fail to spin for various reasons, such as electrical issues, physical damage, or a faulty ESC. The motor is driven by an electric current, and any disruption in the power supply can cause it to stop functioning.
  
- **ESC Issues:** The ESC controls the speed of the drone motors by regulating the current supplied to them. If the ESC is malfunctioning, it may prevent the motor from receiving power, thus causing the motor to remain stationary. Common ESC problems include faulty connections, damaged components, or incorrect settings.

- **Testing with Multimeter:** A multimeter is used to check the continuity of the motor and ESC circuits. It can also measure voltage and resistance to help identify any issues such as broken connections, burnt components, or other electrical faults.

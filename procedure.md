# Procedure
1. **Preliminary Inspection:**  
   - Visually inspect motors and ESCs for any visible signs of damage such as burns, loose connections, or frayed wires.  
   
2. **Testing with Multimeter:**  
   - Use a multimeter to check motor windings for continuity and proper resistance values.  
   - Measure the voltage supplied to the ESC and ensure it matches the required operating values.  

3. **Connection Verification:**  
   - Check wiring connections between the battery, ESC, and motors.  
   - Ensure solder joints are intact and secure.  

4. **Physical Damage Assessment:**  
   - Look for physical cracks, wear and tear, or loose mounting of motors and ESCs.  
   - Replace damaged parts as needed.  

5. **Component Replacement:**  
   - If a component is found faulty (motor or ESC), replace it with a new, compatible unit.  
   
6. **Reassembly and Testing:**  
   - After repairs, reassemble the drone and perform test flights to verify proper functioning.
